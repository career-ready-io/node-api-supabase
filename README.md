# NodeJS, APIs, and Supabase


## Introduction

In this workshop we're going to learn how to use NodeJS to create RESTful APIs that connect to a really cool opensource database called Supabase.


## Getting Started
clone this repository by running the following command:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:career-ready-io/node-api-supabase.git
```

if you haven't setup git or a github profile yet don't worry, there should be a `download` option in the `code` dropdown.

Once you have the starter package simply run `npm install` in the root of the package. Please make sure you are using `node19` or higher version.


## What we will be learning

1. Npm and npm packages
	- We will do a high level overview of what npm is and npm packages are
2. Basic express setup
	- We will talk about express, what it is, and look at the express documentation
3. Dev utilities such as nodemon
	- We will install some nice utilities to help us make development easier
4. Brief overview of what APIs are and why they are important
	- Talk about APIs, REST vs SOAP, HTTP verbs etc.
5. API routes and api best practices
	- Creating API routes!
6. Brief overview of relational databases
	- We will talk about relational databases and why they are soo powerful
	- We will also talk really briefly about non-relational databases
7. Connecting to supabase (postgresql)
	- Connect our API service to supabase
8. Deploy our database via railway
	- Finally, this step is optional, we can deploy our API to railway.
